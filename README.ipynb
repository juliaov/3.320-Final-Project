    "Metadynamics is an enhanced sampling technic that allows us to estimate free energy of the system in the more efficient way than normal molecular dynamics (MD). How does it work? Let me explain this on the toy example of a particle in a potential well. If we initialize the particle at a random point of the well and run classical MD, the particle will go to the minimum and will be stacked there for quite a long time. There is a possibility for a particle to overcome the barrier, however, it is very low, therefore it will take us a long time to go to a different minimum and sample the whole collective variable space (Fig.1). Therefore, a more advanced technic, namely, metadynamics is needed."

    "Let‚Äôs take a look at metadynamics algorithm, which is also reffered to as a computational sand. Each time the particle visits a specific point in collective variable (CV) space, we will add a biasing potential to that point, which will add an additional force and make our particle go to another point in CV space. The bigger the time a particle will spend at one point the higher the barrier gets, which you can see from the formula below. After some time, the particle will explore the whole CV space and the sum of biasing potential together with the free energy will be constant, which allows us to estimate the free energy, using the following formula.

    "Since the method is producing good results, the following question arises: why do we need to enhance metadynamics? First of all, even for relatively small systems, such alanine dipeptide, it will take the algorithm up to 100 ns to converge. For systems with a lot of atoms or systems like proteins it takes even longer to transverse the entire free energy landscape (ùúáùë†). And last but not the least, in case of AIMD and NNFF it takes a lot of computational resources to run the trajectory even for few nanoseconds. Therefore, exploration of the configurational space using these computational methods is very expensive. To overcome these problems we suggest the use of adversarial attacks."

The resulting bias potential will be different for all three trajectories. When the bias potentials are less different from each other, it means that there is a higher possibility that they converged to the value of free energy and respective region of configurational space was explored enough. However, when they are very different from each other, which means there is high uncertainty, the opposite statement is true. Therefore our goal is to move to the place of the higher uncertainty."

However, the following remark is very important. We want not only to maximize the uncertainty but we also want to prevent our system from going to the high-energy region. Therefore, we need to maximize the following function Q. After that we calculate the gradient of the Q with respect to s and move from point s1 to point s2, which will correspond in the following change of normal coordinates $\\Delta r$. "

    "3. The hyper parameters perform intuitively and thus can be implemented by user‚Äôs discretion easily.\n",
    "4. Moving from toy models, the method even works for molecular system like alanine dipeptide. It traverses more collective variable space than in normal metadynamics.\n",
